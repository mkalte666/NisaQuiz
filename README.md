#NisaQuiz
##about

NisaQuiz is a Quiz Application for the NiSaCon in Germany. 
Its based on the 2DRPG engine Dragon2D (https://github.com/DregginGames/Dragon2D). 

You may use it for free - only problem might be that you need our fancy buzzers. And the buzzers hardware is ugh.. not closed source but try to find cad and code on the laptop of the student that wrote/build it xD

Use code as reference or say something if you have questions/need help!

Greetings

Malte
